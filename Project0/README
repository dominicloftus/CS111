Included Files
lab0.c: source code for program that copies from input to output with --segfault
flag to cause a segmentation fault and --catch flag to catch the fault using signal(2).

Makefile: contains default option to build executable, check option to run smoke tests
on program, dist to prepare tar file for distribution, and clean to remove files created
using make.

backtrace.png: a screenshot of gdb running and gathering a backtrace on the
segmentation fault in the program.

breakpoint.png: a screenshot of gdb stopping at a breakpoint and where pointer value
p is set to NULL before the next instruction is executed.


Smoke Tests
checkAccuracy: runs the program and checks for exit code 0, then compares the test
and result files to check for identity.

badFlag: gives the program an unidentified flag and makes sure that it is not
recognized.

badInput: gives the program an input file that doesn't exist.

badOutput: gives the program an output file that doesn't have write permission enabled.

catchSegFault: runs the program with --segfault and --catch enabled and check for exit
code 4.

References
For this project I mainly used the linux man pages for reference on man7.org for help
with function APIs that I needed for lab0.c. I also used a couple stackexchange forums.
I also needed to relearn some of the makefile syntax and bash commands needed for the
make check option. I used the piazza page, youtube videos, and other stackexchange forums
to get the information I needed.
