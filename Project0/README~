lab0.c: source code for program that copies from input to output with --segfault
flag to cause a segmentation fault and --catch flag to catch the fault using signal(2).

Makefile: contains default option to build executable, check option to run smoke tests
on program, dist to prepare tar file for distribution, and clean to remove files created
using make.

segmentation fault in the program.

breakpoint.png: a screenshot of gdb stopping at a breakpoint and where pointer value
p is set to NULL before the next instruction is executed.


Smoke Tests
checkAccuracy: runs the program and checks for exit code 0, then compares the test
and result files to check for identity.

badFlag: gives the program an unidentified flag and makes sure that it is not
recognized.

badInput: gives the program an input file that doesn't exist.

badOutput: gives the program an output file that doesn't have write permission enabled.
