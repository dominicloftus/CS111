For this project I chose to work in c because I knew that after reading the csv
values that the structure and organization that the language provides would make
checking for corruption easy which it was.

Files included

lab3b.c: source file for file system corruption reporting program

Makefile

default: compiles lab3b executable

dist: build tarball

clean: removes executable and tarball
